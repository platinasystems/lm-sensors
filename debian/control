Description: utilities to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors
 Lm-sensors is a hardware health monitoring package for Linux. It allows you
 to access information from temperature, voltage, and fan speed sensors. It
 works with most newer systems.
 .
 This package contains programs to help you set up and read data from
 lm-sensors.
 .
 You will need lm-sensors and i2c kernel modules to use this package.
 For 2.4 kernels, this requires either installing prebuild modules or
 building them using the lm-sensors-source package. For 2.6 kernels,
 use the modules that are already in the kernel tree.
