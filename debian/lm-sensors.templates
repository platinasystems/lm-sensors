_Description: Comparison of negatives have changed
 Starting with version 2.6.3, the comparison of negative voltages have changed
 to be mathematicaly correct.
 .
 For example the following lines in /etc/sensors.conf
 	set in5_max -12 * 1.05
	set in5_min -12 * 0.95
 should be changed into
 	set in5_min -12 * 1.05
 	set in5_max -12 * 0.95
 .
 Please update your sensors.conf if need.
