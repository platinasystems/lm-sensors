lm-sensors (2.6.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Okay, don't actually depend on the exact kernel version.  (Herbert Xu
    claims the kernel ABI shouldn't change appreciably between kernel builds.)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Apr 2002 21:13:13 -0400

lm-sensors (2.6.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't just Recommend the kernel we built against; Depend on it,
    and more precisely, depend on the exact version that was used.

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Apr 2002 10:43:56 -0400

lm-sensors (2.6.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Abandon genchanges.sh, and use debsign to sign the .changes file
    in 'debian/rules kdist'.  This is the same change that was made to
    i2c.

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Apr 2002 18:33:21 -0400

lm-sensors (2.6.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the debconf question about creating /dev entries priority high,
    and have it default to true.  (Closes: #142225)
  * Add a German translation of this question as well; thanks to
    Sebastian Feltel.  (Closes: #119938)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Apr 2002 23:43:51 -0400

lm-sensors (2.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added a helper script (i2ccheck.pl) to find the best version of
    i2c in between what's installed and what's in the kernel.  Use
    that now.
  * The glaring debconf warning points users to README.thinkpad in
    lm-sensors-source; install that.  (Closes: #110595)
  * Added Russian debconf template for lm-sensors...  (Closes: #136597)
  * ...and for lm-sensors-source.  Thanks to Ilgiz Kalmetev for these.
    (Closes: #136929)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Apr 2002 22:41:34 -0500

lm-sensors (2.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: #122102)
  * Update lm-sensors README.Debian to be clearer about how to build
    the kernel modules.  Mention that it's possible to use the i2c
    support in the kernel as of kernel 2.4.13.  Update package
    descriptions, too.
  * No longer have the lm-sensors kernel modules depend on the
    matching i2c kernel modules.  Still keep a suggests around, though.
    (Closes: #120554)
  * For now, disable checking for the existence of i2c modules headers
    when building lm-sensors modules.  This should allow building
    the modules with only the kernel support, but if you have neither
    kernel support nor external modules, you'll lose oddly.  Document
    this failure in the lm-sensors-source README.Debian; it should get
    fixed before too long.

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Dec 2001 22:39:50 -0500

lm-sensors (2.6.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use the right check to see if we're using devfs or not.
    (Closes: #118404)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Nov 2001 22:29:42 -0500

lm-sensors (2.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ask before creating devices (via debconf), but only if we're not
    in a devfs world.  (Closes: #111432)
  * Various clean-ups to make lintian happy once again.

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Nov 2001 21:37:31 -0500

lm-sensors (2.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Not that we support it, but patching 2.4.7
    or newer kernels should work with this release.  (Closes: #107774)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Oct 2001 10:58:21 -0400

lm-sensors (2.6.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eliminate duplicate dependencies on libsensors1.
  * Install extra utility programs (i2cdump, i2cset, isadump) with
    lm-sensors.
  * No longer have the source package conflict with suidmanager,
    since it no longer contains any non-standard permissions.
  * Update lm-sensors README.Debian to mention the dependency on
    i2c-source and known common problems.
  * Added German debconf template; thanks to Sebastian Feltel.
    (Closes: #106894)
  * lm-sensors now Recommends: (not just Suggests:) lm-sensors-mod.
  * 'debian/rules clean' no longer omits the kernel directories,
    so it should work even on the module source.  This should clean
    up people's nasty problems building modules.
    (Closes: #108107, #109065)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Aug 2001 17:11:55 -0400

lm-sensors (2.6.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Let definitions of MODULE_LOC in the environment override the default
    setting.  (Fixes a problem reported on debian-user.)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Jul 2001 12:11:31 -0400

lm-sensors (2.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't include /usr/src/modules or /usr/src/modules/lm-sensors
    in the lm-sensors-source package.  (Apparently this causes conflicts
    with things like pcmcia, and it's not necessary any more.)
    (Closes: #103829)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Jul 2001 16:10:05 -0400

lm-sensors (2.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  This depends on the new upstream i2c as well.
  * !!! NOTE !!!  Upstream claims this release will permanently fry
    IBM ThinkPads!
  * Don't print "modprobe" before lines going in /etc/modules in
    sensors-detect script.  (Closes: #101934)
  * Run /usr/bin/sensors -s in /etc/init.d/sensord to initialize the
    sensor driver.  (Closes: #92792), though not optimally.
  * Good news for bug 94697: i2c-voodoo3 no longer interacts with
    ddcmon.  Bad news: it thinks it can talk to the eeprom driver, so
    there's pretty much the same symptom.  :-(

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Jul 2001 11:09:18 -0400

lm-sensors (2.5.4-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a default for MODULE_LOC in debian/rules, and explain a little
    more about it in lm-sensors-source's README.Debian.

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Sat, 26 May 2001 11:33:24 -0400

lm-sensors (2.5.4-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * lm-sensors-source now depends on bison and flex.  (Closes: #98409)
  * Check for common user errors when building modules.
  * Minor documentation updates.
  * Added logcheck ignore files to not listen to sensord syslog spew.
    (Closes: #98559)

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Sat, 26 May 2001 11:13:53 -0400

lm-sensors (2.5.4-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.  (Closes: #93350)
  * lm-sensors now depends on makedev | devfsd, so that people using devfs
    don't necessarily need to have makedev installed.  (Closes: #96309)
  * Don't unpack the source into /usr/src/modules directly; instead,
    build a tarball in /usr/src/lm-sensors.tar.gz.  This is more consistent
    with what ALSA, OpenAFS, etc. do.
  * It was never correct to put the package out of the modules source
    into $(MODULE_LOC)/..; put the package in $(KSRC)/.. instead.
    (Closes: #94577)  This also causes the package to not be lost under
    the root directory (half of #93545).
  * Build the correct makefile targets when building kernel modules.
    Without doing this, no modules get built.  (Closes: #93545)
  * If the kernel has i2c support, use its i2c headers; otherwise,
    depend on having the i2c-modules-source package installed.  There's
    not a good way to do this with dpkg dependencies.  :-/

 -- David Z Maze <dmaze@debian.org>  Mon, 14 May 2001 20:52:24 -0400

lm-sensors (2.5.4-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only build kernel modules in make-kpkg target; Closes: #89014
  * Added a few more notes about i2c.
  * Use MODULE_LOC, although I can imagine no way on earth that it can be
    better than using ../ . Of course, the bug reporter didn't bother to
    explain his particular configuration, or show any type of log, or any
    type of useful information, so this may not actually Closes: #91828.
    That's their tough luck.
  * Orphaned the package. I'm tired of this monkey on my back.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Apr 2001 21:21:26 -0700

lm-sensors (2.5.4-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the library package only recommend lm-sensors. You may want 
    to install something like mrtgutils w/o dragging in all of
    lm-sensors.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Apr 2001 15:15:26 -0700

lm-sensors (2.5.4-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turned off -w in sensors-detect to shut it up when it finds non-hex
    values in /proc/bus/pci/devices. Closes: #87213

lm-sensors (2.5.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Downgraded dependancy on i2c-source to a suggests, as it is in the

lm-sensors (2.5.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * statoverride transition.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Jan 2001 14:58:59 -0800

lm-sensors (2.5.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-upload with full source, as:
    "Rejected: lm-sensors_2.5.4-3.dsc refers to lm-sensors_2.5.4.orig.tar.gz, but I
    can't find it in Incoming or in the pool." -- becuase
    lm-sensors_2.5.4-2.tar.gz somehow got uploaded. Yuck!
  * Added kdist_clean target, even though it is pretty useless --
    the other kdist_ targets clean up after themselves. Closes: #81360

lm-sensors (2.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Oct 2000 01:26:57 -0400

lm-sensors (2.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved lm-sensors binary package from section misc to section utils
    (well, the override filee will probably still need to be updated to 
    follow suit, so I am actually going to reassign bug #74467 to ftp.d.o).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Oct 2000 11:11:08 -0400

lm-sensors (2.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

lm-sensors (2.5.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt (and build-dends on) debhelper 2.1.9. Earlier versions produced
    postinst/postrm files that did not work on systems with non-modular
    kernels. Closes: #64457

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Sep 2000 20:40:28 -0700

lm-sensors (2.5.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Epoch and version number patch. Closes: #69522

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Sep 2000 16:42:59 -0700

lm-sensors (2.5.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quoted some text used inside a m// in sensors-detect. Closes: #69461
  * Now depends on the current makedev package, which uses /dev/i2c-*, in
    complience with devices.txt and upstream, not /dev/i2c* that Debian 
    used to use for some reason. I belive this Closes: #61670, #65381
  * Note that this means that /dev/i2c0 and /dev/i2c1 will still be around
    after this upgrade. Policy says I cannot remove them; up to admin. So
    be it.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Aug 2000 12:13:14 -0700

lm-sensors (2.5.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

lm-sensors (2.5.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied most of a documentation patch by Josip Rodin. Killed the bit
    about chowning the tree to a user, that's what the src group is for.
    Closes: #65806

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jun 2000 20:25:59 -0700

lm-sensors (2.5.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The source package now installs everything owned by root.src, and
    directories are 2755. This is to mirror the standard permissions of
    /usr/src.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jun 2000 20:48:50 -0700

lm-sensors (2.5.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build .deb in $(KSRC)/.., not $(MOD_DIR)/.. I started using the latter
    by accident in the last release.

  * Listed the (many) authors in debian/copyright. Closes: #64082
  * Enhanced README.Debian in lm-sensors-source, based on the work of Josip
    Rodin. Closes: #64044 (Well, part of it anyway. I disagree with the
    other parts, amd if people want to file multipart bug reports,
    getting them closed like this is the price they pay for that
    convenience.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 15 May 2000 17:05:28 -0700

lm-sensors (2.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new upstream release. Closes: #62362
  * i2c stuff is split off into a separate package. Lots of changes for
    this.
  * Major code tree reogranaization, both upstream and in debian/
  * The shared library is at soname 1 now.
  * Cleaned up the control file handling.
  * genchanges.sh now supports gpg.
  * lm-sensors install now runs MAKEDEV i2c for you.
  * lm-sensors-source uses dh_installmodules to handle maintainer scripts,
    and so depends on the latest version of debhelper, 2.0.96

lm-sensors (2.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * New upstream release with many changes (completly rewritten).
  * Folded in patch from my NMU (#36567).
    - Generate a lm-sensors-source package now, which kernel-package can use
      to build packages that work with a given kernel. Dropped the pre-built
      module package.
  * Re-wrote all the package descriptions.
  * Generate a lm-sensors package with the shared lib and support programs
    in it. This may need to be split into a normal library and bin and dev
    package.
  * Fixed package names of modules packages to properly encode the kernel
    version.
  * Fixed lm-sensors-source postinst and postrm.
  * I still need to deal with some things, including a ton of lintian
    errors. Consider this a snapshot of a not-quite-done package.
