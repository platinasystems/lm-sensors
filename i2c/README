These are the updated i2c drivers, also known as the `Simon Vogl' drivers.

Updated means: more updated than the ones found in the current kernels.

If you have used this package before, please read IMPORTANT_CHANGES!

There are basically two kinds of i2c drivers: drivers for busses and drivers
for chips. Both are cut in two, to isolate common parts: bus drivers are
separated into algorithm drivers and adapter drivers, and chip drivers
are separated into `driver' drivers and client drivers.

This package contains all the basic i2c code, as well as a few bus drivers
(both the algorithm and the adapter drivers). There are no real chip
drivers, so on its own it is not very useful. Lots of chip drivers, as
well as more bus drivers and some additional basic code (for SMBus
emulation over i2c) are found in the lm_sensors package, which is
distributed separately from this package, mainly for historical reasons.
Another place at which I2C is used is the video4linux project.

You can install this package in several ways. One way is by patching your
current kernel. There are some automated scripts in here which can generate
diffs against any (relatively recent) kernel. On the website, there are
also some pre-made diffs available, usually against the latest 2.0,
2.2 and 2.3 kernels.
The second way is by making it directly, which will add some files to your 
current kernel tree. As this is not always welcome, a third way is by making
it completely in the current kernel tree. This will disable versioned
symboling for the symbols in the package modules; this is usually no
problem.
Whichever way you choose, you can always compile the supporting programs
separately.
Please read INSTALL for detailed information.
