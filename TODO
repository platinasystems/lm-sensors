I2C CODE CHANGES
================

See TODO in the i2c package.


KERNEL MODULES
==============

* Add string function in sensors.o
* ALL: cleanup_module is void; check also that cleaning up is done
  properly, now we know that the module will be unloaded whatever we
  do.
* ALL chip drivers: add a readonly insmod option so we don't cause APM/ACPI
  to go insane.
* gl518sm: using iterate==2 causes a tread to be started. this thread remains
  even after setting iterate==1 and/or removing the gl518sm module
  <koenig@uranus.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>
* LM78 detection: Tom Webster has proven that the reset bit in the 
  id register can be one (strange!)
* maxilife.c: Introduce new insmod variables
* maxilife.c: Round REG_TO_VID correctly
* icspll.c: Rewrite. The current implementation simply can't work at all.
  It needs i2c-level access (too bad for SMBus-only adapters).
* w83781d: Some features are still unsupported for the W8378[23].
  Also, alarms seem to give strange results
  sometimes, and there are some other minor problems, as indicated by
  Jonathan Bradshaw <jonathan@NrgUp.Com>
* Support 10-bit addresses. At this moment, they are supported nowhere, except
  in Simon Vogl's i2c modules.
* Better general locking, or at least a once-over to check no race-conditions
  remain. This is part of the SMP-safeness, and can better be done at once.
* adm9240: check whether the current voltage computations are correct.
  Probably not, as they are different from the datasheet specifications.
  Also check for the supported dallas chip.
* lm80: Check how OS alarms work. At page 17 of the sheet, it tells
  something completely different from the description at page 25.
* gl518sm: Assume that new values are close to old values, so start with
  trying to use a small range near the old values (already partially done)
* lm77: Add detection in lm75.c and sensors-detect to distinguish from
  an lm75. Add support for the two new registers.
* Add MTP006F chip: http://www.myson.com/Pcd/MTP006/Mtp006.pdf
  gfiala@s.netic.de (Guido Fiala) has one on his mainboard
* Figure out what chips are appearing at 0x08 and 0x30


LIBRARY
=======

* reload does not work (Bison/Flex problem?).
* Some library routines are pretty inefficient right now.
* Library should be split in more separate files, for better linking
  behaviour.
* Some adm9240 labels start with a digit; change this, it leads to confusing
  syntax in the conf file (they have to be quoted)


PROGRAMS
========

* Sensors program needs to print a + before lm75 temperatures
* Sensors program needs to be extended for many new chips


OTHERS
======

* Examine watchdog-4.3 or later of meskes@debian.org (Michael Meskes)
  tsx-11.mit.edu /pub/linux/sources/sbin or 
  sunsite.unc.edu /pub/linux/system/daemons/watchdog
