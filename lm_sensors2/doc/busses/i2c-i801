Description
-----------

The ICH (properly known as the 82801AA) and ICH0 (82801AB)
are Intel chips that are a part of Intel's '810' chipset
for Celeron-based PCs and '810E' chipset for Pentium-based PCs.

The ICH contains up to SEVEN separate PCI functions
in TWO logical PCI devices.
An output of lspci will show something similar to the following:

  00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2418 (rev 01)
  00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2410 (rev 01)
  00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2411 (rev 01)
  00:1f.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2412 (rev 01)
  00:1f.3 Unknown class [0c05]: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2413 (rev 01)

The SMBus controller is function 3 in device 1f.
Class 0c05 is SMBus Serial Controller.

The ICH chips are quite similar to Intel's PIIX4 chip,
at least in the SMBus controller.

See the file i2c-piix4 for details.
