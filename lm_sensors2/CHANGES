This is a list of the most important changes between 2.x versions. It is by
no means complete, listing only user-visible changes which are interesting.
The ultimate way to know what has changed is to run diff, or even neater,
ask CVS about it:

  * Checkout the archive (see doc/cvs for how you can do this)
  * Determine which tags are valid, by running this command from the
    project root directory:
      cvs status -v -l Makefile
    Valid tags are usually like form V2-1-0 for version 2.1.0
  * Ask cvs for the difference between two versions:
      cvs diff -r TAG1 -r TAG2 DIFF-OPTIONS
    for example:
      cvs diff -r V2-0-0 -r V2-0-1 -u
