Description
-----------

The LM75 implements one temperature sensor. Limits can be set through the
Overtemperature Shutdown register and Hysteresis register. Each value can be 
set and read to half-degree accuracy.
An alarm is issued (usually to a connected LM78) when the temperature
gets higher then the Overtemperature Shutdown value; it stays on until
the temperature falls below the Hysteresis value.
All temperatures are in degrees Celcius, and are guaranteed within a 
range of -55 to +125 degrees.

The LM75 only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often
will do no harm, but will return 'old' values.

The LM75 is usually used in combination with LM78-like chips, to measure
the temperature of the processor(s).

The LM77 is supported as well. It is not distinguished from an LM75
and the two additional registers in the LM77 are not supported.
The prefix in the /proc directory is still 'lm75'.

The DS75 and DS1775 are supported as well.
They are not distinguished from an LM75. While these chips
have three additional bits of accuracy (12 vs. 9 for the LM75),
the additional bits are not supported.
The prefix in the /proc directory is still 'lm75'.
