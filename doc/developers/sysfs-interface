sysfs access (2.6 kernels)
--------------------------

In the 2.6 kernel, sensor chip drivers create subdirectories in
the sysfs filesystem (usually /sys) which can be accessed
directly by applications, or through libsensors as before.

Naming and content standards for the entries in these subdirectories
is documented in the file Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface in the
2.6 kernel source tree.
