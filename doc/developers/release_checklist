CHECKLIST FOR NEW RELEASES
==========================

Release steps:
- Check out i2c and lm-sensors
- Update if necessary, the version number of libsensors
  (edit lib/Module.mk and change LIBMAINVER and/or LIBMINORVER)
  Remember: update main number when interface changes, minor if new
  functionality is added, and patch if only bugs are fixed.
  `svn diff -r Vx-y-z lib' is your friend.
- Update both CHANGES files (add the release date)
- Verify i2c dependency instructions in README, QUICKSTART, and INSTALL,
  update if necessary
- Update lm_sensors.lsm and send it to the LSM by mailing it to 
  lsm@execpc.com with the subject `add' (no quotes).
- Update lm_sensors2/version.h and i2c/kernel/i2c.h
- Commit
- Tag the release using SVN ('???' from the dist root)
- Remove empty directories (e.g. rmdir `find . -type d`)
- Remove 'SVN' related files/directories (e.g. rm -fR `find . -name .svn`)
- Rename i2c and lm_sensors2 to i2c-#.#.# and lm_sensors-#.#.#
- tar it up and post it (sign it)

After release, remember to:
- Copy to mirrors
- Announce on Freshmeat
- Clear support area of unanswered tickets
- Put back ???? for dates
- Prep CHANGES files for next release
