CHECKLIST FOR NEW RELEASES
==========================

release:
- check out i2c and lm_sensors2
- Update if necessary, the version number of libsensors
  (edit lib/Module.mk and change LIBMAINVER and/or LIBMINORVER)

  functionality is added, and patch if only bugs are fixed.
  `cvs diff -r Vx-y-z lib' is your friend.

  update if necessary

- update lm_sensors2/version.h and i2c/kernel/i2c.h, and cvs commit it
- Tag the release using CVS ('cvs tag V#-#-#' from the dist root)
- cvs commit
- remove 'CVS' related files/directories
- tar it up and post it (sign it!)
