Kernel driver `i2c-i801.o'

Status: Tested and stable.
        Block reads/writes untested (but not used by any current chip driver).

Supported adapters:
  * Intel 82801AA and 82801AB (ICH and ICH0 - part of the
    '810' and '810E' chipsets)
  * Intel 82801BA (ICH2 - part of the '815E' chipset)
  * Intel 82801CA/CAM (ICH3)
    Datasheets: Publicly available at the Intel website

Description
-----------

The ICH (properly known as the 82801AA), ICH0 (82801AB),
ICH2 (82801BA) and ICH3 (82801CA/CAM) are Intel chips that are a part of
Intel's '810' chipset for Celeron-based PCs,
'810E' chipset for Pentium-based PCs, '815E' chipset, and others.

The ICH chips contain at least SEVEN separate PCI functions
in TWO logical PCI devices.
An output of lspci will show something similar to the following:

  00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2418 (rev 01)
  00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2410 (rev 01)
  00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2411 (rev 01)
  00:1f.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2412 (rev 01)
  00:1f.3 Unknown class [0c05]: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2413 (rev 01)

The SMBus controller is function 3 in device 1f.
Class 0c05 is SMBus Serial Controller.

The ICH chips are quite similar to Intel's PIIX4 chip,
at least in the SMBus controller.

See the file i2c-piix4 for some additional information.
