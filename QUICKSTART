LM_SENSORS QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------

The instructions in this document will generally work if you have a standard
system, but not always!!

The first part of document is for 2.6 kernel series, second part is for
older 2.4 kernels.

Quickstart for Kernel 2.6 
-------------------------

0) Just compile and install lm-sensors userspace tools. You can do that with:
   'make user; make user_install'
1) Make sure your kernel has support for all I2C bus drivers and
   'i2c device interface'. If you are using a distribution kernel, all is
   already prepared, you don't need to recompile it.
2) Run 'sensors-detect' command, it will tell you what modules you need to load.
3) Load them and run 'sensors' command, you should see some results.
4) Find right section in /etc/sensors.conf, fix labels, limits, fan divisors
5) Run 'sensors -s' to apply the changes.

Quickstart for Kernel 2.4
-------------------------

NOTE: PLEASE SKIM THE INSTALL DOCUMENT, OR BETTER YET READ IT CAREFULLY!

Quickstart for i2c option 1 (modules) and lm_sensors option 1 (modules).
This is by far the EASIEST METHOD.
Other methods are described in INSTALL.
------------------------------------------

  * Verify you are running a 2.4 kernel, 2.4.10 or later.

  * Make sure you have the kernel tree corresponding to your current
    kernel in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build.
    Even if the source is there, it may not correspond to your running
    kernel. If so, you will have to recompile your kernel.

  * Verify that your i2c support in the kernel is configured as
    modules or is disabled. If it is compiled-in, you obviously
    cannot replace it with modules in the next step.

  * Do `lsmod'. If there are any old i2c or sensors modules loaded,
    you MUST remove them (as root) with `rmmod'.

  * Download, build, and install the latest i2c package,
    (i2c-2.9.0 or later). The i2c subsystem found in the Linux 2.4
    kernel trees, even the latest ones, is outdated and won't work.
    Quickstart for i2c: make; (as root) make install

  * Go back to the lm_sensors directory. Do `make'.
    The warnings about .d files at the start are harmless.

  * Do (as root) `make install'.

  * Verify that /usr/local/lib is listed in /etc/ld.so.conf;
    if it isn't, add it, then run (as root) `ldconfig'.

  * Run (as root) `prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh' to create the device files,
    unless you already have them or are running devfs or udev.

  * Run (as root) `prog/detect/sensors-detect' to detect your hardware,
    put the lines it suggests into /etc/modules.conf, and run all
    the commands it suggests (`modprobe X', `sensors -s').

  * Run `sensors' to see your output.

  * That's it! If you have problems, read our excellent FAQ
    (doc/FAQ or doc/lm_sensors-FAQ.html).
